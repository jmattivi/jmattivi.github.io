This is my first post on GitHub Pages!!!!

Most people that know what they're talking about seem to lean toward GitHub Pages for blogging, so I figured I'd give markdown a shot!

I'm going to work on migrating posts from my old blogger site over for a bit to get the hang of markdown, then spin up some new content.
