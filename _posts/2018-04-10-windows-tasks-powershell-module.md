### Why Write A Module
The primary purpose of this module was to run mundane tasks more efficiently than interactively using Remote Desktop.  In other words, what are senseless tasks that can be done with PowerShell rather than wasting time with remote desktop?!?!

The module can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jmattivi/PSWindowsTasks).

### Available Cmdlets
  * Get-DirStats
  * Get-DiskSize
  * Get-LoggedOnUsers
  * Get-PerfCounters
  * Invoke-Parallel
  * Open-Console
  * Remove-LoggedOnUsers

I'm open to suggestions on other miscellaneous tasks that could be included.
