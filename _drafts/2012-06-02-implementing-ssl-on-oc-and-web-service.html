This post I'll explain how to setup SSL on the Orchestration Console  (OC) and Web Service (WS) while also redirecting http traffic to https.&nbsp;  For these examples, I’ve setup the OC on port 443 and the WS on 8443.<br /><br />Since the OC and WS are now hosted through IIS, all the settings will  be set through IIS.&nbsp; First off you need to setup the bindings on the  sites for each like below.&nbsp; I'll explain in a bit why we want to leave  80 enabled in the bindings.<br /><br />Orchestration Console Bindings<br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bindings.jpg?w=1000" title="Bindings" /><br /><br />Within the https port from Edit, you can upload and select the cert you wish to use on the server from the drop down list.<br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-103" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cert.jpg?w=1000" title="Cert" /><br /><br />Web Service Bindings<br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/wsbindings.jpg?w=1000" title="WSBindings" /><br /><br />Now that the OC and WS are enabled for https, we need to setup  redirection from port 80 over to port 443 on the Orchestration Console.&nbsp;  Based on what was previously done, we only need to do this for the OC  since the WS is only enabled for port 8443.&nbsp; For a great resource on the  redirection, see this link that explains how to do this using the URL  Rewrite tool – <a href="http://www.jppinto.com/2010/03/automatically-redirect-http-requests-to-https-on-iis7-using-url-rewrite-2-0/">http://www.jppinto.com/2010/03/automatically-redirect-http-requests-to-https-on-iis7-using-url-rewrite-2-0/</a>.<br /><br />To have the redirection work successfully using the URL Rewrite tool,  it’s necessary that the SSL settings are left at the default NOT to  require SSL on the OC.&nbsp; This allows the traffic to hit port 80 and then  the redirection will kick in.&nbsp; This is why port 80 is left on the  bindings as well.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ssl.jpg?w=1000" title="SSL" /><br /><br />Finally, we need to edit the OC’s web.config file with the new "https://" address and fqdn path of the WS.&nbsp; You can also see at the  bottom of the screenshot below where the URL Rewrite tool adds the  redirection.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/webcon.jpg?w=1000" title="webcon" /><br /><br />If you don't edit the OC’s web.config file, you'll get this error  after opening/logging into the OC since it can’t find the web service.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ocerror.jpg?w=1000" title="ocerror" /><br /><br />Now when you browse to the Orchestration Console on port 80 using the  server's host name, IIS will automatically redirect the connection over  to https.<br /><br />By default, the Orchestration Console and Web Service also have pass  through authentication enabled.&nbsp; If you use privileged accounts to  perform administrative tasks besides the account you regularly login to  Windows with, you’ll also want to setup Basic Authentication on both the  OC and WS.&nbsp; This way when you browse to the site, it will prompt for a  username and password to login with.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-109" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/auth.jpg?w=1000" title="Auth" />
