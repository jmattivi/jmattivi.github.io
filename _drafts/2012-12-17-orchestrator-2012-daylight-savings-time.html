I'm running a little behind on this post as Daylight Savings Time here in the US was back on Sunday, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">November 4.&nbsp; For ease of example, all dates/times will reference the schedule for Daylight Savings in the United States.</span><br /><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><br /></span><span style="white-space: nowrap;">There is an issue with scheduling Runbooks that start with the Monitor Date/Time activity during DST.</span><br /><br />Daylight Saving Time (United States) 2012  began at  2:00 AM   on Sunday, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">March 11.&nbsp; At this time,&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="white-space: nowrap;">the clocks would be moved ahead one hour to 3:00 AM.</span><br /><ul><li><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><span style="background-color: yellow;">This means any Runbooks scheduled to run between the hours of&nbsp; 2:00 AM - 3:00 AM <span style="background-color: lime;">would be skipped entirely</span></span>.</span></li></ul><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><br /></span><br />Daylight Saving Time (United States) 2012 ended at  2:00 AM   on Sunday, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">November 4.&nbsp; At this time,&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="white-space: nowrap;">the clocks would be moved back one hour to 1:00 AM.</span><br /><ul><li><span style="background-color: yellow;"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">This means any Runbooks schedule to run between the hours of 1:00 AM - 2:00 AM</span> <span style="background-color: lime;">would run twice</span><span style="background-color: white;">.</span></span></li></ul><br />Depending on what the runbooks are executing, this could cause major issues and/or unscheduled downtime. It would also suggest Runbooks that are not set on an hourly interval (i.e. once daily) be scheduled outside of the hours of 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM to avoid any interruptions.&nbsp; Unless you throw an exception into the schedule to work around the timing that the clocks are changed.
