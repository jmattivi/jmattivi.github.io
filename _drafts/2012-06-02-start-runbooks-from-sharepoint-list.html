After stopping all running/pending runbooks to perform maintenance on the SCOrch environment, it becomes cumbersome to start all runbooks that begin with a monitor date/time activity (especially when the number of runbooks to start climbs above 100….).<br /><br />You can create a SharePoint list (Figure A) of runbooks that need to be started after maintenance (good to document nonetheless) that Orchestrator can reference to start all of them automatically!<br /><br />The main field that we need to use is the RunbookID in the SP list.&nbsp; I also use a field called "Active" in the list to exclude workflows that may not need started in case there is any reason that they shouldn't be started for the time being.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-62" height="104" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/blog-20120214-sp-list1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=104" title="Blog-20120214-SP-List" width="1024" /> Figure A<br /><br />The workflow is made up of three runbooks.&nbsp; A main which queries the SP list for the active runbook ids to start, the execute which starts the targeted runbook, and a seperate runbook to keep track of processed runbooks to later check for any errors.<br /><br />Main (Figure B)<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/blog-20120214-main.jpg?w=1000" title="Blog-20120214-Main" />Figure B<br /><br />The main starts by resetting a counter to cleanup from previous runs.&nbsp; Then it uses the Microsoft SharePoint IP by Jeff Fanjoy (more info here <a href="http://orchestrator.codeplex.com/releases/view/75877">http://orchestrator.codeplex.com/releases/view/75877</a>) to query the list identified in the SP IP configuration in options.&nbsp; Within the properties of the Get Active Runbooks activity, the filter is modified to choose the "Active" field set on the list object (Figure C).<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/blog-20120214-spactivity.jpg?w=1000" title="Blog-20120214-SPActivity" />Figure C<br /><br />From the runbooks found in the list query, it will invoke the execute runbook with the runbook id and runbook name.&nbsp; It also invokes the counter modification runbook with a parameter – increment (note this invoke must set the property to wait for completion – See Figure E).<br /><br />Exploring the execute runbook that's invoked in Figure D….it uses the Standard Logging IP (more info here <a href="http://orchestrator.codeplex.com/releases/view/76097">http://orchestrator.codeplex.com/releases/view/76097</a>).&nbsp; It starts the targeted runbook (you can reference this from my previous post – <a href="http://jmattivi.blogspot.com/2012/06/scorch-powershell-to-start-runbook-part.html">http://jmattivi.blogspot.com/2012/06/scorch-powershell-to-start-runbook-part.html</a>).&nbsp; Upon success or failure to start the runbook, it invokes the counter modification runbook with a parameter – decrement (note this invoke must set the property to wait for completion – See Figure E).<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-67" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/blog-20120214-execute.jpg?w=1000" title="Blog-20120214-Execute" />Figure D<br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/blog-20120214-counter.jpg?w=1000" title="Blog-20120214-Counter" />Figure E<br /><br />Moving back to the Main runbook (Figure B), it waits for the counter value to be 0 – indicating processing has completed.&nbsp; If not it hits a timeout after 15 minutes and sends an error email for investigation.&nbsp; It then queries the Standard Logging table in the database for any failures to start runbooks from the execute runbook.&nbsp; If errors are found, it uses a Powershell script to parse the flattened data back into multi-valued data and send that information in an email.&nbsp; If no failures are found, it sends a success email that all targeted scheduled runbooks have been started successfully.
