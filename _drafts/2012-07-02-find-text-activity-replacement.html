I've encountered an issue a few times now where I need to use the Find Text activity to search a rather large (~20MB) txt or log file for a specific string.&nbsp; The PolicyModule process would spike to around 25% proc utilization for every Runbook Instance running.&nbsp; Set the job concurrency to four or more instances and you can do the math to see this becomes an issue :).&nbsp; On top of that....the activity would take around 20 minutes to complete for each instance.<br /><br />Once again PowerShell comes to the rescue.&nbsp; You can easily port the activity over to the Run .Net Script activity and set the Published Data field for "result" using the below example.<br /><br />$file = "C:\temp\myfiletosearch.txt"<br />$searchtext = "Specific string to find here"<br /><br />$content = Get-Content -Path $file | Select | Where {($_ -like "*$searchtext*")}<br /><br />If ($content -ne $null)<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $result = "Text Found"<br />}<br />Else<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $result = "Text NOT Found"<br />}
