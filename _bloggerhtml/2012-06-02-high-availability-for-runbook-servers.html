Here's just a quick tidbit for specifying runbook servers used in the  Invoke Runbook standard activity.&nbsp; It’s beneficial to keep the runbook  server names stored in Global Variables.&nbsp; This way you can insert the  variable in the Invoke Runbook activity instead of hardcoding the server  name.<br /><br />In case a runbook server has issues and is powered down or  unavailable, the invoke runbook activity will automatically start the  invoked runbook on the next runbook server in line.&nbsp; Another benefit is  the ability to add/remove runbook servers and just update a variable  than trying to find/replace every invoke runbook activity w/ the new  server name.<br /><br />You can also use the variables to group runbook servers based on  their role in the environment.&nbsp; So to load balance runbooks, depending  on how many runbook servers you have (for this example we’ll say three  internal).&nbsp; You could specify three variables which have the following  values.<br /><br />Primary:&nbsp; myrunbookserver1;myrunbookserver2;myrunbookserver3<br />Secondary:&nbsp; myrunbookserver2;myrunbookserver3;myrunbookserver1<br />Tertiary:&nbsp; myrunbookserver3;myrunbookserver1;myrunbookserver2<br /><br />So for runbook servers interacting w/ servers on an internal domain you could use:<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/var1.jpg?w=1000" title="var1" /><br /><br />So for runbook servers interacting w/ servers on a dmz domain you could use:<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/var2.jpg?w=1000" title="var2" /><br /><br />Finally, subscribe to the variable in the Invoke Runbook activity.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128" src="http://jmattivi.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/invoke.jpg?w=1000" title="invoke" />
