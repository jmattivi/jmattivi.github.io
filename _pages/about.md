I am a Lead Systems Engineer in the healthcare industry.

### What I do
My main focuses are automation and configuration management.  I'm constantly striving to enrich my PowerShell skills and provide my peers with code to become more efficient in day-to-day tasks.  I made the career shift to automation after using scripts daily to automate every tedious task that I could in Windows and Exchange administration.

### Background
My background revolves around Microsoft products and the System Center suite, primarily -
  * Orchestrator
  * ConfigMgr
  * OpsMgr

Lately I've been focused on migrating to Azure Automation.

### Blogging
I've previously blogged about System Center Orchestrator after it's release and migrating from Opalis.  Those posts can be found under the "Blogger Posts" section above.

Five years later and after having kids, changing jobs, moving, building a new house, etc....I'm hoping to devote more time to sharing random ideas here.
